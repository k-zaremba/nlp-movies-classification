# Text classification using NLP with Word2Vec & Tensorflow

➡️ This project is focused on developing Neural Network able to classify a movie's genre based on its description. [language: English]

📊 Dataset used : [Genre Classification Dataset IMDb](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb)

📝 The project itself covers the challenges of text preprocessing & should be treated as an introduction to Natural Language Processing.

📝 Later on, the NN classifying Polish corpus will be added to the project repo

## To run project

1. Navigate to your project directory and create new virtual environment with 
> python -m venv ./env

2. Activate the environment
> ./env/Scripts/activate

3. Install dependencies
> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Download required *nltk* libs (will be changed)
> python -m nltk.downloader all

5. Open jupyter-notebook and select *env* as python environment

6. [Download dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb?resource=download) and place it inside your project folder
